        <h1>Career goals</h1>
        <time>July 28, 2025</time>
        <p>
            I am eager to pursue an internship at Nintendo. 
            I would prefer an intership in Website Content Management, where I can apply and expand my skills in web development, content creation, and digital marketing. 
            I have hands-on experience building websites, including this portfolio site using HTML/CSS and www.wzzorg.nl using WordPress. 
            I have also experimented with creating a database using PHP, XAMPP, and phpMyAdmin.
            These projects have given me a strong understanding of web design, user experience, and content management systems.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to my technical skills, I have a growing interest in digital marketing and am proficient in MS Office, with a particular focus on improving my Excel skills to better analyze and manage digital content. 
            I am confident that my combination of web development expertise, creative mindset, and attention to detail would allow me to contribute effectively to Nintendoâ€™s online platforms.
            <br>
            <br>
            With a foundation in both game development and web development, I am passionate about creating interactive experiences that inspire and connect people. 
            My long-term goal is to work at a company like Nintendo, where I can contribute to innovative and meaningful games. 
            I aim to begin my career as a QA Tester or Game Tester, gaining hands-on experience in gameplay systems and production pipelines. 
            As I continue to build on the skills and knowledge from my Creative Media & Game Technologies studies, my aspiration is to grow into roles such as Game Designer and eventually Game Director.
            <br>
            <br>
            In parallel, I plan to establish my own business; either a game studio or a web development agency. 
            Having already delivered websites for external clients, I have a solid foundation to expand my web development services. 
            Recognizing the competitive nature of the game industry, I envision starting my game studio as a side project, gradually building an even bigger portfolio of unique, engaging and more professional games.
            <br>
            <br>
            As side goals, I would love to record a movie voice, start a theater group with a group of theater friends, and write a book one day.
            <br>
            <br>
            Whether contributing to a AAA studio or starting my own business, I am committed to continuous learning, creative problem-solving, and building experiences that make a lasting impact.
