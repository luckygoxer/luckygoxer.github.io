        <h1>Career goals</h1>
        <time>February 3, 2026</time>
        <h2>Internship motivation</h2>
        <p>
            I am eager to pursue an internship at Nintendo in the year 2026-2027. 
            I have a growing interest in digital marketing and advertising, and am proficient in MS Office, with a particular focus on improving my Excel skills to better analyze and manage digital content. 
            I am fluent in spoken and written English and Dutch, and have a working proficiency in German, which allows me to collaborate across different cultures and markets. 
            My combination of web development expertise, creative mindset, and attention to detail makes me confident that I would contribute effectively to Nintendo's online platforms and marketing strategies. 
            I want to broaden my professional skills by gaining hands-on experience in gaming-focused marketing. 
            I think this connects greatly with my studies in the Netherlands called Creative Media & Game Technologies, especially with my field as a Game Designer. 
            Here, I gained experience in Unity, C#, Level Design, Game Design, and Gamification, and have effectively led teams utilizing positive feedback to create video games in Unity. 
            These projects taught me how to work closely, cooperatively, and effectively with different team members with different roles (e.g., Engineer, Artist, etc.) 
            Leading people with mental disabilities as a volunteer at ASVZ has helped make my interpersonal skills stronger by learning how to effectively communicate with people on a different cognitive level than I. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to my interest in PR, marketing, and journalism, I possess broad knowledge in many areas, making me a versatile candidate. 
            I can apply and expand my skills in web development, content creation, and digital marketing. 
            I have hands-on experience building websites, including this portfolio site using HTML/CSS and www.wzzorg.nl using WordPress, and have also experimented with creating a database using PHP, XAMPP, and phpMyAdmin. 
            These projects have given me a strong understanding of web design, graphic design, user experience, and content management systems. 
            Having already delivered projects to external clients, I have a solid foundation in combining technical precision with creativity to produce meaningful results and expand my web development services.
            <br>
            <br>
            Currently, I am developing my graphic design skills in Adobe Photoshop, and have followed an 
            <a href="EducationandCourses.html#PremiereProTraining">Adobe-certified Premiere Pro training</a>
            from an Adobe Learning Partner. 
            This training gives a comprehensive overview of the features and interface of Premiere Pro in the version 2025, the various editing workflows, and file management. 
            I am learning important new skills that I have no experience with yet, like masking effects, sound editing, and the latest AI-based features, and I will acquire important skills that offer significant added value to a media professional. 
            <br>
            <br>
            With a foundation in both game development and web development, I am passionate about creating interactive experiences that inspire and connect people. 
            I am committed to continuous learning, creative problem-solving, and building experiences that make a lasting impact, which shows in my hard work and starting a project well-prepared. 
            With experience in personal branding, design thinking, business thinking, leadership, and time management, I believe I would be a valuable addition to the company.
            <br>
            <br>
            Considering all of this, I would love to pursue an internship at Nintendo in the year 2026-2027 to broaden my skills and knowledge and to be able to make an impact on the gaming industry. 
            I hope this gives you an insight into my passion for Nintendo, Game Design and the video game industry. 
            I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and passion can contribute to Nintendo's projects.
            I am confident that I can contribute to innovative campaigns that reflect Nintendo's unique brand identity.
            <br>
            <br>
        <h2>Long-term goals</h2>
            My long-term goal is to work at a company like Nintendo, where I can contribute to innovative and meaningful games. 
            I aim to begin my career as a QA Tester or Game Tester, gaining hands-on experience in gameplay systems and production pipelines. 
            As I continue to build on the skills and knowledge from my Creative Media & Game Technologies studies, I aspire to grow into roles such as Game Designer and eventually Game Director.
            <br>
            <br>
            In parallel, I plan to establish my own business; either a game studio or a web development agency. 
            Having already delivered websites for external clients, I have a solid foundation to expand my web development services. 
            Recognizing the competitive nature of the game industry, I envision starting my game studio as a side project, gradually building an even bigger portfolio of unique, engaging, and more professional games.
            <br>
            <br>
            As side goals, I would love to record a movie voice, start a theater group with a group of friends, and write a book one day.
            <br>
            <br>
            In December of 2025, I made my musical debut as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3oMGoKAKPkB8QvetxDp9kZ?si=jcgTsTutSJaIN_yNK9S5uA" target="_blank">Luke on the hill</a> on all major streaming platforms with two other artists. <a href="https://push.fm/fl/iikwv1hz" target="_blank">Listen to our first song called 'Grain of Soul' here!</a> 
            <br>
            <br>
            Whether contributing to a AAA studio or starting my own business, I am committed to continuous learning, creative problem-solving, and building experiences that make a lasting impact.

        <h1 id="InternDenda">Intern Game Design at Denda Games</h1>
        <time>Current internship</time>
        <p>
            I am currently following an internship in Game Design at <a href="https://denda-corporate.com" target="_blank">Denda Games</a> in Hengelo.
            As a Game Designer at Denda Games, my team and I, consisting of a fellow artist and a game designer, me, will be collaborating on existing projects within the company. 
            We will convert Denda Games’ web games to entertainment versions.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://denda-corporate.com" target="_blank">Denda Games</a> is a young and direct company that creates game ports from mobile games to web versions and collaborates with studios like Halfbrick Studios, Mindscape Games, and Twin Win Games LLC. 
            They also distribute their own games, like Sudoblock, Kruiswoordpuzzel, and Sudoku, to major platforms like DPG, CNN, AD, and RTL. 
            Together with DPG Media, Denda Games has reached 10 million HTML5 online gamers each month. 
            Besides managing the HTML5 games portal and the content relating to it, Denda Games has also produced and adjusted HTML5 games.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our main task is creating new HTML5 versions of the classic games Nonogram and Minesweeper in the Defold engine in collaboration with Poki, preparing them for the Poki environment, and distributing them to different online platforms. 
            This includes developing and refining the gameplay concept, writing down the design document for the game, and using the research findings to inform the design for the Poki platform and player experience. 
            These games are targeted for the rapidly growing online Poki platform. 
            <a href="https://poki.com" target="_blank">Poki.com</a> is a website for playing free online games on your mobile, tablet, or computer.  
            <br>
            <br>
            I will be led by Jacques Neuvel and the team of permanent workers every step along the way. I will use various types of online documentation to learn about the Defold engine, the Poki developers' environment, etc.
            Based on research, game mechanics can be quickly introduced and tested within the Poki environment. A solid foundation acts as a starting point to create different levels and environments.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through constant reflection on my work, seeking feedback, and recording my learning process, I will be developing all <a href="EducationandCourses.html#CMGT">CMGT</a> competencies effectively throughout my internship.
            <br>
            <br>
            To enhance my technical knowledge, I plan to work with the Defold engine to create games and integrate them with the Poki platform. This will enable me to learn how the mechanics of the game are implemented, how JSON is used to create puzzles and progress, and how the limitations of the platform are used to create the technical aspects of the games. Additionally, this involves implementing and fine-tuning gameplay mechanics, handling JSON data, comprehending engine pipelines, and closely cooperating with developers and artists to ensure that designs are technically viable and properly implemented.
            <br>
            <br>
            I will plan my work, think about my progress, and be accountable for my part in the project. This enables me to improve in terms of professionalism, collaboration, and self-direction. By sharing ideas, researching new concepts, and being proactive about my contributions, I hope to make a difference in the projects and the company beyond my original scope of work.
