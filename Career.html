        <h1>Career goals</h1>
        <time>December 11, 2025</time>
        <h2>Internship</h2>
        <p>
            I am eager to pursue an internship at Nintendo. 
            I have a growing interest in digital marketing and advertising, and am proficient in MS Office, with a particular focus on improving my Excel skills to better analyze and manage digital content. 
            I am fluent in spoken and written English and Dutch, and have a working proficiency in German, which allows me to collaborate across different cultures and markets. 
            My combination of web development expertise, creative mindset, and attention to detail makes me confident that I would contribute effectively to Nintendo's online platforms and marketing strategies. 
            I want to broaden my professional skills by gaining hands-on experience in gaming-focused marketing. 
            I think this connects greatly with my studies in the Netherlands called Creative Media & Game Technologies, especially with my field as a Game Designer. 
            Here, I gained experience in Unity, C#, Level Design, Game Design, and Gamification, and have effectively led teams utilizing positive feedback to create video games in Unity. 
            These projects taught me how to work closely, cooperatively, and effectively with different team members with different roles (e.g., Engineer, Artist, etc.) 
            Leading people with mental disabilities as a volunteer at ASVZ has helped make my interpersonal skills stronger by learning how to effectively communicate with people on a different cognitive level than I. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to my interest in PR, marketing, and journalism, I possess broad knowledge in many areas, making me a versatile candidate. 
            I can apply and expand my skills in web development, content creation, and digital marketing. 
            I have hands-on experience building websites, including this portfolio site using HTML/CSS and www.wzzorg.nl using WordPress, and have also experimented with creating a database using PHP, XAMPP, and phpMyAdmin. 
            These projects have given me a strong understanding of web design, graphic design, user experience, and content management systems. 
            Having already delivered projects to external clients, I have a solid foundation in combining technical precision with creativity to produce meaningful results and expand my web development services.
            <br>
            <br>
            Currently, I am developing my graphic design skills in Adobe Photoshop, and I am following an 
            <a href="EducationandCourses.html#PremiereProTraining">Adobe-certified Premiere Pro training</a>
            from an Adobe Learning Partner. 
            This training gives a comprehensive overview of the features and interface of Premiere Pro in the current version 2025, the various editing workflows, and file management. 
            I am learning important new skills that I have no experience with yet, like masking effects, sound editing, and the latest AI-based features, and I will acquire important skills that offer significant added value to a media professional. 
            <br>
            <br>
            With a foundation in both game development and web development, I am passionate about creating interactive experiences that inspire and connect people. 
            I am committed to continuous learning, creative problem-solving, and building experiences that make a lasting impact, which shows in my hard work and starting a project well-prepared. 
            With experience in personal branding, design thinking, business thinking, leadership, and time management, I believe I would be a valuable addition to the company.
            <br>
            <br>
            Considering all of this, I would love to pursue an internship at Nintendo to broaden my skills and knowledge and to be able to make an impact on the gaming industry. 
            I hope this gives you an insight into my passion for Nintendo, Game Design and the video game industry. 
            I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and passion can contribute to Nintendo's projects.
            I am confident that I can contribute to innovative campaigns that reflect Nintendo's unique brand identity.
            <br>
            <br>
        <h2>Long-term goals</h2>
            My long-term goal is to work at a company like Nintendo, where I can contribute to innovative and meaningful games. 
            I aim to begin my career as a QA Tester or Game Tester, gaining hands-on experience in gameplay systems and production pipelines. 
            As I continue to build on the skills and knowledge from my Creative Media & Game Technologies studies, I aspire to grow into roles such as Game Designer and eventually Game Director.
            <br>
            <br>
            In parallel, I plan to establish my own business; either a game studio or a web development agency. 
            Having already delivered websites for external clients, I have a solid foundation to expand my web development services. 
            Recognizing the competitive nature of the game industry, I envision starting my game studio as a side project, gradually building an even bigger portfolio of unique, engaging, and more professional games.
            <br>
            <br>
            As side goals, I would love to record a movie voice, start a theater group with a group of friends, and write a book one day.
            <br>
            <br>
            Whether contributing to a AAA studio or starting my own business, I am committed to continuous learning, creative problem-solving, and building experiences that make a lasting impact.
