        <h1>Minor European Project Semester Gamification</h1>
        <time>September 15, 2025</time>
        <p>
            From September 2025 to January 2026, I am pursuing a minor European Project Semester at Fachhochschule St. Pölten in Austria as part of my studies, with a focus on Gamification.
            This is not a specific, pre-defined program but rather tailored tasks to the individual profiles of accepted students. 
            From the four focuses: Edutainment, Data, Engineering, and Journalism, I have chosen the focus of Edutainment.
            This focus requires competence in one or more of these fields: audio, video & film production, animation, graphic design, games, gamification, serious games, exergames, and storytelling. 
            This connects greatly with my studies in the Netherlands called Creative Media & Game Technologies. 
            Especially with my field as a Game Designer, because I already have experience in Unity, C#, Level Design, Game Design, and Gamification. 
            On top of the Multidisciplinary Project and accompanying subjects, I am pursuing a German course and three additional subjects called Freifächer. 
        <br>
        <br>
            The Deutsch 2 course is the highest German program the FHSTP has to offer. 
            The course is meant for learners with some knowledge of German on the first basic user level of CEFR. 
            I finished my German course in high school with a 7/10 at NLQF 4 / EQF 4 level, which is roughly around B1 level on the CEFR Global Scale, so I am beyond the first level. 
            Fortunately, in Deutsch 2 there is a bigger focus on grammar and speaking which are a key aspects when learning a new language. 
        <br>
        <br>
            My first elective course is a Certified Adobe Premiere Pro CC Training 101.
            I am following this course in German.
            This Freifach gives a comprehensive overview of the features and interface of Premiere Pro in the current version 2025, the various editing workflows, and file management. 
            I will learn important new skills that I have no experience with yet, like managing footage from different camera types, how to quickly create a rough cut, functions in the source monitor and program monitor, basics of effects editing (e.g., fades, motion effects, color correction, filters, etc.), color correction with the Lumetri Panel, masking effects, sound editing with Essential Sound, exporting the edited film in a variety of formats, and the latest AI-based features. 
            This Adobe-certified training from an Adobe Learning Partner is a great addition to my portfolio, and I will acquire important skills that offer significant added value for a media professional.
        <br>
        <br>
            The second elective course is called How to Become Self-Employed. 
            I am following this course in German.
            This Freifach gives practical advice to students who want to start their own business (part-time) during their studies or after graduation. In this elective course, I will find answers to the most important questions about self-employment, like: What do I need to establish a successful business from the start? What formal steps are necessary? (business license, tax office, social security, etc.) What pitfalls are there, and how can I avoid them?
            For a successful start to self-employment, this elective course covers: what "self-employment" actually means (works contract, freelance contract, freelancer, etc.), confidentiality, "part-time" self-employed vs. "fully" self-employed, taxes and duties, accounting basics: income and expenditure accounting, correct invoices (fee notes), and networking and partnerships.
        <br>
        <br>
            The last elective course is called Scouting Austrian Culture.
            This Freifach consists of workshop sessions on Austrian culture.
            For example, collecting and contributing facts and experiences on Austrian geography, history, arts, music, and further topics of interest, including participation in excursions. 
            I love art and history, so this subject intrigues me very much. 
            Learning about the Austrian culture and its rich history was part of why I wanted to come to FHSTP. 
        <br>
        <br>
            The school is located in St. Pölten, which is about an hour away from Vienna. 
            In Vienna, there are a lot of museums, and I would like to visit them in my free time. 
            The Museum of Natural History Vienna, for example. 
            There are many beautiful buildings and castles, a rich history, and much to learn. 
            I’ve heard Vienna has a great connection with music, a big passion of mine, especially Mozart, of course. 
            On top of this, Austria has a beautiful landscape.

        <h1>Creative Media and Game Technologies</h1>
        <time>September, 2023 - present</time>
        <p>
            Since September 2023 I have been studying for a Bachelor of Applied Science called Creative Media and Game Technologies at Saxion University of Applied Sciences, because I am extremely interested in creating and designing games. 
        <br>
        <br>
            Here I have been pursuing courses giving me basic proficiency in Communication, Design Thinking, Imagery, Programming, Game Design, Sound Design, 3D Modeling, Behaviorism, Cinematics, Personal Branding, Unity Game Scripting, Advanced Web, Business Thinking, Immersive Storytelling, Advanced UI/UX Design, Gamification, and Procedural Art, among others. 
            On top of these courses, I followed eight three-week group projects. 
            In addition, I have worked on numerous personal portfolio items, like <a href="https://luckygoxer.github.io/3DModels.html">a 3D animation</a>, <a href="https://luckygoxer.github.io/WebDesign.html#WZZorg">a website for Wij Zijn Zorg</a>, and <a href="https://luckygoxer.github.io/WebDesign.html#MySQL">creating and securing a database</a>.
        <br>
        <br>            
            I hope to finish this study in June of 2027. 
            I have passed my first year with no insufficient grades and passed my propaedeutic year with all 60 ECs and an average grade of 8,0/10. 
            I have passed my second year as well with an average grade of 7,9/10.
            Currently, I am in my third year, pursuing a minor European Project Semester at Fachhochschule St. Pölten in Austria as part of my studies, with a focus on Gamification.

            From September 2021 until June 2022 I took singing lessons at Muziekschool Werkendam.

        <time>August, 2018 - May, 2023</time>
        <p>From August 2018 until May 2023 I studied at the Fortes Lyceum in Gorinchem in the Netherlands. 
            I graduated at Havo level with a Natuur & Gezondheid en Natuur & Techniek (Nature & Health and Nature & Technology) profile. 
            Because I needed extra challenge for a few subjects, I took my final exams in Dutch and English at VWO level. 
            My average grade was 7/10.
            The curriculum included the subjects: Dutch (VWO), English (VWO), German, Mathematics for the hard sciences (Wiskunde B), Physics, Chemistry, Biology, 
            Theater & Media, History of Arts, Cultural and artistic education, and Social studies.
