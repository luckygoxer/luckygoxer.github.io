        <h1>Study goals</h1>
        <time>July 17, 2025</time>
        <p>
            From September 2025 to January 2026, I am going to do the minor: European Project Semester (EPS) at St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences (FHSTP) in Austria. 
            This is not a specific pre-defined project but rather tailored tasks to the individual profiles of accepted students. 
            From the four focuses: Edutainment, Data, Engineering, and Journalism, I have chosen the focus Edutainment.
            This focus requires competence in one or more of these fields: audio, video & film production, animation, graphic design, games, gamification, serious games, exergames, and storytelling. 
            This connects greatly with my studies in the Netherlands called Creative Media & Game Technologies. 
            Especially with my field as a Game Designer, because I already have experience in Unity, C#, Level Design, Game Design and Gamification. 
        <br>
        <br>
            Outside the Multidisciplinary Project and accompanying subjects, I would very much like to do the Scouting Austrian Culture which consists of workshop sessions on Austrian culture.
            For example, collecting and contributing facts and experiences on Austrian geography, history, arts, music, and further topics of interest, including participation in excursions. 
            I love art and history, so this subject intrigues me very much. 
            The Scouting Austrian Culture course was part of why I wanted to come to FHSTP. 
            I love art and history, so this subject intrigues me very much.
        <br>
        <br>
            The school is located in St. Pölten, which is about an hour away from Vienna. 
            In Vienna, there are a lot of museums, and I would like to visit them in my free time. 
            The Museum of Natural History Vienna for example. 
            There are many beautiful buildings and castles, a rich history, and much to learn. 
            I’ve heard Vienna has a great connection with music, a big passion of mine, especially Mozart of course. 
            On top of this, Austria has an amazing landscape.

        <time>September, 2023 - present</time>
        <p>
            Since September 2023 I have been studying for a Bachelor of Applied Science called Creative Media and Game Technologies at Saxion University of Applied Sciences. 
            I am extremely interested in creating and designing games. 
            Currently, I am in my third year. 
            I hope to finish this study in June of 2027. 
            I have passed my first year with no insufficient grades and passed my propaedeutic year with all 60 ECs and an average grade of 8,0/10. 
            I have passed my second year as well with an average grade of 7,9/10.

        <p>
            From September 2021 until June 2022 I took singing lessons at Muziekschool Werkendam.
            Here I acquired various skills, such as sustaining notes and reach.
            This has greatly helped me progress in theater and my band.

        <time>August, 2018 - May, 2023</time>
        <p>From August 2018 until May 2023 I studied at the Fortes Lyceum in Gorinchem in the Netherlands. 
            I graduated at Havo level with a Natuur & Gezondheid en Natuur & Techniek (Nature & Health and Nature & Technology) profile. 
            Because I needed extra challenge for a few subjects, I took my final exams in Dutch and English at VWO level. 
            My average grade was 7/10.
            The curriculum included the subjects: Dutch (VWO), English (VWO), German, Mathematics for the hard sciences (Wiskunde B), Physics, Chemistry, Biology, 
            Theater & Media, History of Arts, Cultural and artistic education, and Social studies.
