        <h1 id="Minor">Minor European Project Semester Gamification</h1>
        <time>September, 2025 - January, 2026</time>
        <p>
            From September 2025 to January 2026, I have pursued a minor European Project Semester at the University of Applied Sciences St. Pölten in Austria as part of my studies, with a focus on Gamification.
            From the four focuses: Edutainment, Data, Engineering, and Journalism, I have chosen the focus of Edutainment.
            This focus requires competence in fields like: audio, video & film production, animation, graphic design, games, gamification, serious games, XR-games, and storytelling. 
            This connects greatly with my studies in the Netherlands called <a href="#CMGT">Creative Media & Game Technologies</a>. 
            Especially with my field as a Game Designer, because I already have experience in Unity, C#, Level Design, Game Design, and Gamification. 
            I have followed courses on Scrum, Serious Gaming & Gamification, Teambuilding & Project coaching, Virtual Reality Workshops, and <a href="EdelweissValley.html">a Multidisciplinary Project</a>, which I finished with a 9,3/10. 
            On top of the Multidisciplinary Project and accompanying subjects, I have pursued a German course and three additional subjects called Freifächer. 
        <br>
        <br>
            The Deutsch 2 course is the highest German program USTP has to offer. 
            The course is meant for learners with some knowledge of German at the first basic user level of CEFR. 
            I finished my German course in high school with a 7/10 at NLQF 4 / EQF 4 level, which is roughly around B1 level on the CEFR Global Scale, so I am beyond the first level. 
            Fortunately, in Deutsch 2, there is a bigger focus on grammar and speaking, which are key aspects when learning a new language. 
        <br>
        <br>
            My first elective course was an Adobe-certified Premiere Pro training from an Adobe Learning Partner.
            I have followed this course in German. 
            This Freifach provided a comprehensive overview of the features and interface of Premiere Pro in the 2025 version, 
            <span id="PremiereProTraining"></span>
            as well as various editing workflows and file management. 
            I have acquired important new skills that I previously lacked, such as masking effects, sound editing, and the latest AI-based features, and I have developed valuable skills that offer significant added value to a media professional. 

        <br>
        <br>
            The second elective course was called How to Become Self-Employed. 
            I have followed this course in German.
            This Freifach gave practical advice to students who want to start their own business (part-time) during their studies or after graduation. 
            For a successful start to self-employment, this elective course covered: what "self-employment" actually means, confidentiality, "part-time" self-employed vs. "fully" self-employed, and networking and partnerships.
        <br>
        <br>
            The last elective course was called Scouting Austrian Culture.
            This Freifach consists of workshop sessions on Austrian culture.
            For example, collecting and contributing facts and experiences on Austrian geography, history, arts, music, and further topics of interest, including participation in excursions. 
            I love art and history, so this subject intrigued me very much. 
            Learning about the Austrian culture and its rich history was part of why I wanted to come to USTP. 
        <br>
        <br>
            The school is located in St. Pölten, which is about half an hour away from Vienna. 
            In Vienna, there are a lot of museums, and I could visit them in my free time. 
            The Museum of Natural History Vienna, for example. 
            There are many beautiful buildings and castles, a rich history, and much to learn. 
            Vienna has a great connection with music, a big passion of mine, especially Mozart, of course. 
            On top of this, I could explore Austria's beautiful landscape.

        <time>September, 2023 - present</time>
        <p>
            Since September 2023 I have been studying for a Bachelor of Applied Science called Creative Media and Game Technologies at Saxion University of Applied Sciences, because I am extremely interested in creating and designing games. 
        <br>
        <br>
            In the first two years, I have been pursuing courses giving me basic proficiency in Communication, Design Thinking, Imagery, Programming, Game Design, Sound Design, 3D Modeling, Behaviorism, Cinematics, Personal Branding, Unity Game Scripting, Advanced Web, Business Thinking, Immersive Storytelling, Advanced UI/UX Design, Gamification, and Procedural Art, among others. 
            On top of these courses, I followed eight three-week group projects. 
            In addition, I have worked on numerous personal portfolio items, like <a href="https://luckygoxer.github.io/3DModels.html">a 3D animation</a>, <a href="https://luckygoxer.github.io/WebDesign.html#WZZorg">a website for Wij Zijn Zorg</a>, and <a href="https://luckygoxer.github.io/WebDesign.html#MySQL">creating and securing a database</a>.
        <br>
        <br>            
            In my third year, I have pursued a 
            <a href="#Minor">minor European Project Semester</a> 
            with a focus on Gamification at the University of Applied Sciences St. Pölten in Austria as part of my studies. 
            We finished the project with a 9,3/10. 
        <br>
        <br>
            I am currently following an <a href="Career.html#InternDenda">internship in Game Design</a> at <a href="https://denda-corporate.com" target="_blank">Denda Games</a> in Hengelo.
            As a Game Designer at Denda Games, my team and I, consisting of a fellow artist and a game designer, me, will be collaborating on existing projects within the company. 
            We will convert Denda Games’ web games to entertainment versions, and I may serve as Lead Designer and Product Owner. 
        <br>
        <br>
            I have passed my first year with no insufficient grades and passed my propaedeutic year with all 60 ECs and an average grade of 8,0/10. 
            I have passed my second year as well with an average grade of 7,7/10.
            I am currently in my third year with an average grade of 9,3/10.
            I hope to finish my studies in June of 2027.

            From September 2021 until June 2022 I took singing lessons at Muziekschool Werkendam.
            Here I acquired various skills, such as sustaining notes and reach.
            This has greatly helped me progress in theater and my band.

        <p>From August 2018 until May 2023 I studied at the Fortes Lyceum in Gorinchem in the Netherlands. 
            I graduated at Havo level with a Natuur & Gezondheid en Natuur & Techniek (Nature & Health and Nature & Technology) profile. 
            Because I needed extra challenge for a few subjects, I took my final exams in Dutch and English at VWO level. 
            My average grade was 7/10.
            The curriculum included the subjects: Dutch (VWO), English (VWO), German, Mathematics for the hard sciences (Wiskunde B), Physics, Chemistry, Biology, 
            Theater & Media, History of Arts, Cultural and artistic education, and Social studies.
