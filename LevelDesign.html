    <br>
        <time>June 28, 2019 - present</time>
        <p>
        I have created many levels in the Super Mario Maker 2 game. 
        As a maker, <br> I now have over 530 likes on my courses and over 5,300 Maker Points. 
        Anyone who owns Super Mario Maker 2 can play my levels with my Maker ID: <b>NGB-1TS-0TF</b>. 
        Here you can look at what kind of levels I make and of what quality. Please do not hesitate to give it a try.
    <br>
    <br>
        Many of my levels are experiments with new mechanics, the new game style; Super Mario 3D World, and new updates. 
        Some levels are replicas of previous 2D or 3D Mario games. 
        Furthermore, many levels are based on one mechanic used uniquely each time, or that becomes slightly more difficult each time. 
        Finally, there are several puzzle levels and even a recreated boss fight from Assassin’s Creed Origins. 
        I have also recreated games such as The Legend of Zelda and Captain Toad.
    <br>
    <br>
        My Super World contains 5 courses with interesting mechanics. 
        Each level in this world is based on a different power-up. 
        Each stage therefore works differently and is full of small, short puzzles.
        I will display some highlights below.
    <br>
    <br>
        <h2>Bowser's Fury in a Koopa Shell!</h2>
        <time>April 24, 2023</time>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/SuperMarioMaker2.7.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperMarioMaker2.7">
    <br>
        This is a screenshot of Bowser's Fury in a Koopa shell! 
        I have not finished this level either, but it is the sequel to Mario 3D World in a Koopa Shell! which can already be played in Super Mario Maker 2.
    <br>
    <br>
        <h2>Mario’s Creed Origins</h2>
        <time>April 21, 2020</time>
        <img class="smallsmall2" class="smallsmall" src="images/Level Design/SuperMarioMaker2.1.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperMarioMaker2.1">
    <br>
        This level is called: Mario’s Creed Origins. 
        I have recreated the boss battle with the giant snake in Assassin’s Creed: Origins in this level.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/SuperMarioMaker2.2.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperMarioMaker2.2">
    <br>
        Here you can see how the setup works. 
        After the snake spawns, Mario is expected to hit the on-off switch. 
        After that, a timer will be activated, and the switch will turn back.
        <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/SuperMarioMaker2.3.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperMarioMaker2.3">
    <br>
        Because Mario does not have a crossbow, I gave him a Fire Flower. 
        After a couple of hits to the on-off switch, the snake will be defeated, and the player can escape through the pipe.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>One 3D Screen Puzzle</h2>
        <time>January 5, 2020</time>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/SuperMarioMaker2.4.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperMarioMaker2.4">
    <br>
        This level is a one-screen puzzle in the Super Mario 3D World game style. 
        The player has to figure out what to do next to progress in the level.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Slēnderman (PEGI 3)</h2>
        <time>December 3, 2019</time>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/SuperMarioMaker2.6.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperMarioMaker2.6">
        <br>
        In this level, the player can only look to one side; otherwise, the floor will disappear and Mario will die.
        In the top left you can see the setup.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Super Mario 3D World in a Koopa Shell!</h2>
        <time>June 9, 2019</time>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/SuperMarioMaker2.5.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperMarioMaker2.5">
        This level is called Super Mario 3D World in a Koopa Shell! 
        It takes you through the entire Super Mario 3D World game in one level.
        It takes you from Super Bell Hill all the way to the final ending.

    <time>January 3, 2019 - present</time>
    <p>
        In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, I made a custom stage in the stage builder based on Honeylune Ridge from Super Mario Odyssey. 
        This is the last kingdom in Super Mario Odyssey. 
        I always thought this kingdom was a cool concept and wanted this as a stage in Smash. 
        Unfortunately, it never came officially, but there was a free update in which the community could create their stages.
        Of course, I recreated the kingdom in a stage and Jump Up, Super Star! plays in the background.
        Anyone who owns Super Smash Bros. Ultimate can play my stage with the stage ID: <b>H7N9DWY4</b>. 
        Here you can look at the stage I made and of what quality. Please do not hesitate to give it a try.
    <br>
    <br>
        <h2>Honeylune Ridge</h2>
        <time>January 3, 2019</time>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/SuperSmashBros.Ultimate1.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperSmashBros.Ultimate1">
    <br>
        Here you can see the stage I made. 
        The church is made of stone, ice for the windows, and lava for the red carpet.
        As shown here, the Odyssey, Mario's airship, moves back and forth all over the stage. 
        The bottom is a semi-solid platform, which means you can go through it from below and stand on top. 
        The Odyssey is in the foreground, so the player stands on the back of the Odyssey. 
        As a result, the player cannot see what is going on here.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/SuperSmashBros.Ultimate2.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperSmashBros.Ultimate2">
    <br>
        Here you can see a checkpoint flag, which you can teleport to in Super Mario Odyssey.
        I made a portal behind the flag on the left and the pipe on the right. 
        This allows you to quickly move from one side of the stage to the other.
        This ensures exciting battles with new strategies. 
        This is of course also a reference to Super Mario Odyssey in which you end up in a completely different zone through pipes.    
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/SuperSmashBros.Ultimate3.jpg" height="300px" alt="SuperSmashBros.Ultimate3">
    <br>
        Here is one last screenshot showing the entire stage including the church, the Odyssey, the pipe, and the checkpoint flag. 
        The bell can be seen at the top, which bounces away players who bump into it.
        The stage was uploaded online and is simply called Honeylune Ridge. 
        Anyone who has played Super Smash Bros. Ultimate can play this stage by going to Online, Shared Content, Search (X), ID, JL5R6H62. 
        The maker, me, is called luckygoxer. 
        So do not hesitate to give it a try.

    <time>January 3, 2019 - present</time>
    <p>
        In Fortnite Creative I designed some games. 
        I have made some platform/deathrun maps, two of which I will show you.
        You must be an Epic Games Creator to upload Fortnite Creative maps. 
        Unfortunately, I am not one, so I cannot upload my maps for them to try. 
        For this reason, I will try to give the best possible picture of the maps using screenshots.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Icy Toes</h2>
    <time>January 3, 2019</time>
    <p>
        The name of this map is Icy Toes. 
        It is a deathrun/platform challenge.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite1.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite1">
    <br>
        There is ice everywhere you can walk. 
        In addition, some platforms even turn your feet into ice blocks and make them slippery. 
        Hence the name Ice Toes.    
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite2.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite2">
    <br>
        The entire map is full of bounce pads. 
        One mistake and you die.
        Well-timed jumps are literally vital in this game.
    <br>
    <br>
        <h2>Forted League</h2>
        <time>January 3, 2023</time>
    <p>
        Now comes a completely different kind of map: Forted Leak. 
        In this map, I tried to recreate Rocket League in Fortnite. 
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite3.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite3">
    <br>
        This project started long before it was announced that Rocket League would be acquired by Epic Games. 
        This is why the Octane cars are not used in this map, but the (then) standard Fortnite quads. 
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite4.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite4">
    <br>
        You play this game by hitting the ball with your quad, trying to get it into the goal. 
        On the side are bounce pads and speed boosters. 
        In the middle on the sides are platforms that freeze your tires as an extra obstacle. 
        This is based on Rocket League sidemodes with items.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite5.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite5">
    <br>
        If you are successful, the ball is destroyed in the goal, so that it spawns again in the middle, just like in Rocket League.
        The use of the turbo is essential in this game, because the ball does not roll as smoothly as in Rocket League itself.
        </p>
    <br>
        <h2>Deathrun 3.1</h2>
        <time>December 4, 2023</time>
        <p>My biggest project in Fortnite is called Deathrun 3.1. 
        This is a platform map based on Deathrun 3.0. 
        In this map, you platform your way through the levels. 
        Every mistake means game over, and you have to start from the last checkpoint.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite6.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite6">
    <br>
        Of course, every good challenge starts with a brief introduction.
        The map starts with the so-called trapbaiting, in which you must activate a trap to pass it.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite7.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite7">
    <br>
        Then the player's feet are turned into blocks of ice, and they must platform a piece, while trying to maintain their speed.
        When the player arrives at checkpoint 2, he realizes he must go back.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite8.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite8">
    <br>
        He then finds out that checkpoint 3 was next to the exit from the beginning.
        The player falls down after seeing an arrow on the ground and must land on a bounce pad.
        This is how it looks from behind.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite9.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite9">
    <br>
        Then the player climbs up without touching the bounce pads and ice platforms, otherwise the player falls down a long way.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite10.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite10">
    <br>
        Using a grappler, the player climbs up to find the next checkpoint here. 
        This is a short introduction to the next level.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite11.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite11">
    <br>
        In this level the player must jump all the way to the other side by means of the grappler. 
        The player can swing up to 10 times and when he hits the ground he dies.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite12.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite12">
    <br>
        This is followed by a bit of parcour on a hoverboard.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite13.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite13">
    <br>
        After completing the entire course, the game ends with a thank you for playing.
    <br>
    <br>
        <img class="smallsmall2" src="images/Level Design/Fortnite14.jpg" height="300px" alt="Fortnite14">
    <br>
        And this is what the map looks like from the top.
