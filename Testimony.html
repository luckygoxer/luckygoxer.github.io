        <h1>All about Jesus</h1>
        <p>
            Jesus is my Friend and my Big Brother. 
            He has forgiven my sins, healed me from illness, and helped me break through addictions. 
            Through Him, I can come to the Father and experience the power of the Holy Spirit. 
            There is nothing and no one I'd rather be with than Him, and He is the reason I live and continue to live. 
            I want to tell people about Him and share Him with everyone around me. 
            I strive to deny myself and become more like Him, sharing His love with the world in everything I do.

        <h1>Testimony</h1>
        <p>
            In high school, I experienced faith in Jesus for the first time as my own. 
            When I had to switch schools, I started to have serious doubts about my faith: is it right, why do we believe, and why would I want to be a part of it?
            <br>
            <br>
            I then delved much deeper into science and other faiths. 
            Ultimately, I concluded that science and faith don't contradict each other and, more often than not, go hand in hand. 
            I also discovered that Christianity is the only faith where you don't have to <i>do</i> anything before you <i>achieve</i> something. 
            All you have to do is accept and follow Jesus. 
            He finished everything when He willingly died for our sins and sicknesses. 
            He rose on the third day, and through Him, we can get to God the Father. 
            If you truly follow Jesus, you can't sit still anyway, but you don't <i>have</i> to do anything first to receive salvation. 
            In no other faith is there a person like Jesus, with love so pure.
            <br>
            <br>
            I realized this was the only thing that <i>could</i> be right. 
            I talked to a lot of people, and the final conclusion was always "get baptized." 
            I found this difficult because, for me, baptism always seemed like some kind of ultimate end; a kind of enlightenment. 
            I discovered that baptism is actually the first step on your journey with God, not the end. 
            After much hesitation, I made the choice: all or nothing. In other words, everything. 
            After this, I contacted an elder in the church and got baptized.

        <h1>Broken tailbone</h1>
        <p>
            I suffered from a broken tailbone for a long time. 
            This caused intense shooting pains when standing up and sitting down. 
            The tailbone could be moved apart from the spine, and was loose in my back. 
            Standing and sitting for long periods was also very painful. 
            This was during the lockdowns, when I sat in my desk chair for hours at a time to attend online classes, so this wasn't an ideal time for this. 
            The doctor said he couldn't do anything for me; if it were ever to heal, it could only heal naturally over many years. 
            I suffered from this for about a year and a half, when I received a prophecy that I would be healed. 
            They prayed for me, but it didn't go away. 
            Some time later, after my baptism, I went to a healing service. 
            There, they asked people with back pain to stand. 
            They prayed for me, and the pain was sent away in the name of Jesus. 
            I didn't feel anything spectacular happening in my body at the time. 
            However, I was asked to try to do what I couldn't do. 
            I sat and stood up several times, and did squats. 
            I had no more pain, and the pain was completely gone. 
            The tailbone was attached to the spine again and could not be moved. 
            I have never experienced these pains ever again. 
            What a miracle!

        <h1>Addiction</h1>
        <p>
            Jesus helped me break free from an addiction I'd been trapped in for over 10 years. 
            He broke the chains of sin in my life and brought restoration to the place I thought I could never escape from bad thinking patterns, depression, and sin. 
            He is Lord of heaven and earth and can bring restoration to every area of your life!
