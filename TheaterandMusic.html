    <h2>Singing</h2>
    <time>June 14, 2024</time>
    <p>Aside from theater, I have had singing lessons for 2 years. 
    The first year because I wanted to develop and improve my skills and the second year to practice for my role as Danny Zucko in the musical Grease. 
    I have also been singing in a couple of bands, like the church band and the band of my student association.</p>

    <h2>Dance</h2>
    <time>June 14, 2024</time>
    <p>I danced many times in plays. 
    In the musical Grease for example, I had to dance too. 
    Therefore, we decided to take dancing lessons. 
    This was not a specific style of dance but corresponds to the original dance in the movie Grease. 
    In other plays I have danced too.
    I have also had dance lessons in the Quick Step and the Cha Cha.</p>

        <time>December 12, 2025</time>
        <p>In December of 2025, I made my musical debut as Luke on the hill on all major streaming platforms with two other artists. <a href="https://push.fm/fl/iikwv1hz" target="_blank">Listen to our first song called 'Grain of Soul' here!</a>

        <p>I also starred in our modern version of Grease in which I, as Danny Zucko, had the lead role. 
        We tried to make a more current, Dutch version of the film, in the form of a musical with lots of singing, dancing and humor. 
        <sup>[1]</sup>
        This is Danny and Sandy's first meeting since the summer. 
        Danny does not know whether to act tough or show his sweet side to Sandy.
        <sup>[2]</sup>
        After some ups and downs between the couple, they decide to enter their high school's dance competition.
        <sup>[3]</sup>
        Unfortunately, Danny's ex arrives; Cha Cha, throwing a spanner in the works and exchanges herself for Sandy during the dance. 
        This causes Cha Cha and Danny to win the match and not Sandy.

        <p>After a challenge from Leo, Ken decides to race against him. 
            For this his car must be made as fast and as greasy as possible and the other two T-birds are of course happy to help with this.

            <sup>[6]</sup>
            <sup>[7]</sup>
            After the song Greased Lightning, where Danny takes the spotlight, the car is fixed up and ready for the race.

        <p>This is the climactic race from the original Grease movie. 
            Because Ken had an injury, Danny has decided to take on Leo for him.
            After an intense Mario Kart race on office chairs, Danny wins and the school's honor is saved!
            <sup>[9]</sup>
            <sup>[10]</sup>
            Danny has decided to change for Sandy and has changed his outfit for this, among other things.
            After deciding that, after high school, the group will never break up, one last dance follows and so does a smashing conclusion to the musical.

        <figcaption>Our play about the flood</figcaption></figure>
        <p>This is a self-made story about time travelers and a flood in 2022.  
        We produced this last play at the end of last school year and performed at the reunion of the Fortes Lyceum. The roles included a stressed 50's housewife who panics because her “taters” are boiling over, an 80's junkie who only thinks about weed and beer, and a young guy from the (new) 20s who grows up in a vastly different way than the other two did. 
        This boy talks about lockdowns, climate change, a second “water disaster” that (happened in the Netherlands in 1953,) and Dutch rap with a terrible dance.
        This was our first play that we made completely on our own.
    <br>
    <br>
        During this project, I learned a lot about <b>Immersive Storytelling</b>, <b>Communication</b>, <b>Teamwork</b>, and <b>Problem-Solving</b>.

    <h1>Theater</h1>
    <time>June 14, 2024</time>
    <p>I have done theater since I was very little. I used to play in church Christmas musicals and primary school plays, for example. 
    In high school, I took the Theater & Media course, where I received professional lessons and learned how to make a theater play myself, how to build a TV studio, and make movies. 
    I have already staged and created countless plays, including the story of Abraham and Sarah who are visited by God Himself and the Greek tragedy about King Oedipus.
    Above are our most noteworthy plays.
