                <h1 id="portfolio">Personal Portfolio Website</h1>
                <time>March 5, 2024 - present</time>
                <h2 id="about">About</h2>
                <p>This page will show how I created my professional online presence. 
                    First, I will provide a specific description of my target audience, define the goals for my online presence, and show my strategies. 
                    I will show testing sessions, feedback, and how I created fitting solutions to problems that came up. 
                    This way I created multiple prototypes and iterations to refine my online presence. 
                    Screenshots are included to demonstrate everything I made and how I did it. 
                    In the end, I have created a professional personal website serving as a portfolio and resume.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h2 id="Web">Web</h2>
                <p>
                    <figure><img src="images/Web Design/My_Wireframe.jpg" alt="ProcessPictures"></figure>
                    I started by creating this website as an experiment for the Web module. 
                    It was just a silly project with random quirks as a test for the things that I learned and the capabilities of HTML and CSS. 
                    I started by creating a wireframe for my website with the elements that a website needs to have. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    I made a section with a &lt;header&gt;, an &lt;aside&gt;, and a &lt;main&gt;. 
                    I wanted the header to have a &lt;figure&gt; with a logo in it. 
                    I also wanted a &lt;nav&gt; functioning as a navigation bar for the different pages. 
                    I wanted to incorporate a slideshow in the &lt;header&gt; as the background. 
                    The &lt;header&gt; should be position: sticky; so it will stay at the top when the website is scrolled on.
                <br>
                <br>
                    For the &lt;aside&gt;, I wanted &lt;figure&gt;s with &lt;figcaption&gt;s. 
                    The latter would explain what is visible in the picture. 
                    In the &lt;main&gt;, I wanted &lt;article&gt;s with text. If needed, a &lt;figure&gt; with &lt;figcaption&gt; could be added. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    Lastly, I wanted a &lt;footer&gt; with a &lt;nav&gt; for my social media.
                <br>
                <br>
                    <figure><img src="images/Web Design/First Version.png" alt="ProcessPictures"></figure>
                    This was the first version I made. 
                    The &lt;header&gt; has a &lt;nav&gt; and a &lt;figure&gt; with a logo. Only the slideshow has not been utilized here. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    I made an &lt;aside&gt;, with &lt;figure&gt;s with &lt;figcaptions&gt;s and text. 
                    I also created a box-shadow when the &lt;figure&gt;s are hovered over. 
                    The &lt;main&gt; has &lt;article&gt;s with text, and a &lt;figure&gt; with a &lt;figcaption&gt;. 
                    I made the background-color: aliceblue; to be easier to look at.
                <br>
                <br>
                    <figure><img src="images/Web Design/First Footer.png" alt="ProcessPictures"></figure>
                    I incorporated a slideshow in some of the &lt;figure&gt;s in the main. 
                    This way, more images can be displayed on the website while the website will not have an extreme height.
                <br>
                <br>        
                    Lastly, I made a &lt;footer&gt; with a &lt;nav&gt; for my social media and even a form to contact me.
                <br>
                <br>    
                    Because this was a prototype, some elements were random and not optimized. 
                    Still, many elements ended up in this website; the final product, in one way or another.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2 id="Personal Branding">Personal Branding</h2>
                    After the Web module, I had a new goal in mind: using this website as a proffessional personal portfolio.
                    I continued to improve the website during the Personal Branding module.
                <br>
                <br>
                    In the emphasize phase, I broadened and deepened my insights into the needs and wants of my target audience and the effectiveness of my online presence.
                <br>
                <br>    
                    In the define phase, I synthesized my collected information from the empathize phase to specific insights on personal branding, positioning in the work field, and target audience definition. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    In the ideate phase, I explored and analyzed design possibilities. 
                    I created a range of ideas and concepts and made choices on the effectiveness of my online presence. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                    In the prototype phase, I made a lot of prototypes for my website. 
                    Each time I made improvements to my website. 
                <br>
                <br>       
                    In the test phase, I did a lot of testing sessions with a wide range of users. 
                    This way, I got valuable feedback on how the website should work and look. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                    After the testing phase, the cycle repeats; emphasizing, defining, ideating, creating a new prototype, and doing another test. 
                    Using this long cycle, I created an intuitive and aesthetic website in the end. 
                    My online presence now contains a range of portfolio items and is easily accessible and expandable. 
                    It is unique and personal and has the personal style that I was hoping to achieve. 
                    I hope this website will support me in a potential job application and will form the foundation with which a professional network is created.
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the first emphasize phase,</b> I analyzed others’ portfolios and took inspiration from them. 
                    For privacy reasons, I have not included the portfolios of said designers, but I will include my analyses.  
                    <ul >
                        <li>I like that this portfolio starts with an ‘About’ and social media links. 
                            I also like that it is clear and to the point, but I don’t like how incredibly simplistic this website is. 
                            I think it can have a little bit of personality, as long as it does not take away from the clarity and simplicity. </li>
                        <li>I like how the games are displayed with an image, link, about, studio, and platforms. 
                            It is easy to understand and clear to see what is going on. </li>
                        <li>I like the color in the navigation bar at the top, it makes it clearer than keeping everything the same color. 
                            This portfolio is also very clear with a touch more personality. </li>
                        <li>I like the color in the navigation bar at the top, it makes it clearer than keeping everything the same color. 
                            This portfolio is also very clear with a touch more personality. </li>
                        <li>I find this portfolio clear and easy to read due to the use of colors (dark mode, orange text). 
                            I don’t like the informal speech to be honest. 
                            You can use that for peers, but not in the professional industry. </li>
                    </ul>
                    After this, I did some research on jobs in the creative industry. 
                    All of these jobs require you to have good communication skills and a creative background, like creative study for example. 
                    For some jobs, you have to speak English very well because you will talk to many different kinds of people, sometimes even across countries. 
                    For most jobs, you need to have at least an HBO diploma and preferably 1(+) year(s) of experience. 
                    I have good writing skills and a great passion for games and the creative industry. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the define phase,</b> I decided what my goals were. My goal is to create a professional online presence by creating an online website. 
                    I want to update it frequently. This way, it will stay up to date with my skills and knowledge, so employers know who I am and what I am good at. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                    I want to have an ‘About’ and social media links. 
                    I want it to be clear and to the point, while having a little personality, as long as it does not take away from the clarity and simplicity. 
                    I want my games displayed with images, links, about, (studio), and platforms, so it is easy to understand and clear to see what is going on. 
                    I want to have a bit of color, to make it clearer and give it a bit of personality.  
                    You can use that for peers, but not in the professional industry. 
                    I am targeting designers because I am aiming for a designer job. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    After this, I thought about the product requirements.

                <br>
                    Must

                    <b>In the prototype phase,</b> I created an MVP (minimal viable product). 
                    I started with creating the basics of the website, like the navigation bar, main article, aside, and footer. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    After this, I have been trying out various styles and color schemes. 
                    I settled on a personal style that I was happy with. 
                    <figure><img src="images/Web Design/Code2.jpg" alt="ProcessPictures"></figure>
                <br>
                <br>
                    It is a soft color palette creating a bit of personality, but will not take away from the clarity. 
                <br>
                <br> 
                    Afterwards, I started building different pages. 
                    I have tried to stay consistent, while also making every page a bit different.  
                <br>
                <br>
                    The hard parts were creating a good layout for the website and getting margins and paddings right. 
                    I mainly used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> to gather information about how to fix these. 
                    On this website, I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    I had not yet finished all the pages of my website, but I had three pages finished. 
                    I have used these as the testing prototype. 
                    This prototype was the most completed one, so it would give the best indication of what I wanted the website to be like. 
                    That is why I have used this one for testing. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the testing phase,</b> I uploaded my website on luckygoxer.github.io. Unfortunately, my testers lived far away and I was not able to get a look at their reaction. 
                    I got a lot of responses, mostly spelling mistakes. 
                    One tester specializes in the English language. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    This was the feedback that the tester specializing in English gave: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>You must be an Epic Games Creator to upload Fortnite Creative maps. Unfortunately, I am not one me, so I cannot upload my maps for them to try. ('I am not one me' is not correct English) </li>
                        <li>In this map you platform, your way through the levels. (Delete the comma) </li>
                        <li>and a self-made story about time travelers and a flood in 2022. (There is no start of the sentence) </li>
                        <li>Here are our most noteworthy plays. ('Above are our most noteworthy plays' because I showed them above, not below) </li>
                        <li>Sustainability (sustaining notes (for clarity)) </li>
                        <li>August 2020 until May 2023 (I was in high school for a longer time, so August 2018) </li>
                        <li>the Havo level (delete ‘the’) </li>
                        <li>Art general (history of arts (for clarity)) </li>
                        <li>Brothers in Christ want to serve teenagers (wants) </li>
                        <li>Server (waiter) </li>
                        <li>Continue using the (Super Mario-inspired) fonts as used in ‘About Me’ and ‘About Games’ </li>
                        <li>The scrolling photos for Vettig de Musical are cool</em> </li>
                    </ul>
                    I also asked a former recruiter/hiring manager in the creative industry for feedback and this was what he told me: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Use uniform colors, especially for social media logos at the bottom. 
                            Some, like Itch, are barely visible when hovering over them. </li>
                        <li>Is theater necessary? The focus is on Game Design and getting an internship later.</em> 
                            (My solution: this website focuses on Game Design, but not ‘just’ that. Maybe link skills with theater?) </li>
                        <li><em>Make the Contact Me form use one font. Now the name line and the text line for example use different fonts. </li>
                        <li>Show more of the process behind your games. </li>
                        <li>Delete the shadows when hovering. They’re “ugly and distracting”.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    For the second iteration, I repeated the cycle.
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the second empathize phase,</b> I processed the feedback from the last test. 
                    I found it would be appropriate to create a page for my games. 
                    This fits with the needs of my target audience; a company that would want to hire me. 
                    There was also not a good way to contact me yet. 
                    I had social media links and a contact form in mind. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the define phase,</b> I decided that the page would display who made it, what was made, for what platform, where to download it, and some visuals like pictures. 
                    I also want to create social media links and a contact form. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the ideate phase,</b> I was thinking about creating one page for my games, but I could also make one for every game. 
                    I chose to create separate pages, so the information would not collide and get confusing. 
                    Also, this way everything stays clear and the page will not be extremely long. 
                    For the way to contact me, I could create a Contact Me page, or put the Contact Me form on every page. 
                    I chose to put the Contact Me form in the footer on every page except the home screen. 
                    This way the form is always there on every page and is very clearly visible on the most important page. 
                    I also put my relevant social media in the footer. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the prototype phase,</b> I started building different pages. 
                    I have tried to stay consistent, while also making every page a bit different again, starting with the way to contact me on every page. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    After this, I started to work on the individual game pages. 
                    I created a good layout that I used for all the games. 
                    I also implemented some visuals in the aside after testing different layouts. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    The hard parts were creating a good layout for the new pages and creating a unique page every time. 
                    I mainly used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> to gather information about how to fix the first issue. 
                    On this website, I have learned more about HTML and CSS. At the moment I had all the pages that I wanted to be finished. 
                    I have used these as the testing prototype. 
                    This prototype was the most completed one, so it would give the best indication of what I wanted the website to be like. 
                    That is why I have used this one for testing. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the testing phase,</b> I asked a quality assurance tester at Nintendo of Europe if he wanted to test my website and this was his response: 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <em>It's looking great! I always like seeing people doing it on GitHub, the most convenient way in my opinion and right next to your repositories if you need to show off your programming skills. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    I think your portfolio looks good, personally I am never here to judge any style, format or look of a portfolio website. 
                    In the end the most important part is that it should give clear information about your skills and capabilities, and projects you worked on. 
                    As long as you stick to that it will be good.  
                <br>
                <br>
                    I think the only thing I would mention is add what you added to the process and development of your projects, I don't know if they're all solo or in a team but in both cases: talk about what your roles were in the project, if there was a certain objective or goal and how you went about achieving that.  
                <br>
                <br>
                    For example it would be great to read more about the design processes behind your projects if that is something you're passionate about. 
                    Also for your Mario Maker levels! if there was a certain thought behind it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    I hope that helps, it reminds me that I should also update my portfolio haha 
                <br>
                <br>
                    Kind regards</em>
                <br>
                <br>
                    I asked a Game Designer who has been creating Indies for over 10 years for feedback and this was what he told me: 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <em>First impression is a good and proeffesional one, but maybe make the contact thingy on the side a bit less colory. 
                    Some simple whites and greys would go a long way there. </em>
                    (I think it is fine, because I want it to ‘pop’, because it is the most important thing on the website; the call to action. 
                    With this reasoning, the former recruiter/hiring manager agreed with me.)  
                <br>
                <br>   
                    <em>First thing that pops into the eye on the games page is the yoshi and rapunzel icons. 
                    I don't know how to feel about this considering both are other peopls IPs and i assume you didn't make those pictures right? :D 
                    Like they are not fanart or anything? 
                    Because if not, I would maybe get rid of them since this portfolio should tell people about your skills first and foremost right? 
                <br>
                <br>     
                    Next: the luckygoxer logo is clearly nintendo inspired. 
                    I totally get the energy, believe me. xD 
                    But for a potential employer or business partner this is a very heavy red flag. 
                    I would much rather use something you came up with entirely from scratch. 
                    It's fine if it "doesn't look too good" as long as its yours and has its own identity 
                <br>
                <br>     
                    The level design page is fine btw (in case you where wondering :D) 
                    Since it clearly presents that its about content you created in those games. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                    Education and courses page would look better if you give the panels on the right the same white and grey treatement i was talking about earlier.  
                <br>
                <br> 
                    Same for skills. 
                    You could also use that blue in all of them if you prefer, it's not too offensive in conjunction with the rest. </em>
                    (I chose this color palette because it doesn’t distract too much from the website, but it does give the website some personality. Using grey and white, I found the website becomes bland and boring.) 
                <br>
                <br>    
                    This was the feedback a third-year Creative Business student gave me: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>C# in Unity is different from ‘normal’ C#, it would be smart to mention which one you are doing. </li>
                        <li>Maybe combine HTML and CSS and think of a third thing in which you are developing your skills.</li>
                        <li>On the About Me page, switch the second and third paragraphs around. </li>
                        <li>On the About Games page, add visuals from your games that people can click on. 
                            They are more willing to click on a picture than on a word. </li>
                        <li>The rest looks good. 
                            The theater page is very nice to see. </li>
                        <li>Maybe downscale some images for faster loading times, but that is optional. </em></li>
                    </ul>
                    For the final iteration, I repeated the cycle one last time.
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the third empathize phase,</b> I processed a lot of the feedback from the last test, like the visuals on the games page for example. 
                    People are more willing to click on a picture than on a word. 
                    I fixed many bugs as well in this revision. 
                    Because I already fixed many things and most feedback was incorporated into my website, this revision is not a drastic overhaul and has mostly small changes. 
                    I found it would be helpful to get people to the game pages in some way. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the define phase,</b> I have been thinking about visuals on the About Games page for people to click on. 
                    This way they will immediately know what pages there are and will be directed to the page they click on.  
                <br>
                <br>
                    <b>In the ideate phase,</b> I was thinking about a colored button or a screenshot of the game for the visuals on the About Games page. 
                    The screenshot would be the most appealing picture and would display what the page is about.  
                <br>
                <br>
                    <figure><img src="images/Web Design/Games.jpg" alt="ProcessPictures"></figure>
                    <b>In the prototype phase,</b> I created a combination of a screenshot with the name of the game. 
                    This way people immediately know what is on the page and what the name of the game is. 
                    These screenshots need to lure them in to click on the pages. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    I have created a professional online presence by creating an online website. 
                    This online presence is effective because I can update it frequently and easily. 
                    This way, it will stay up to date with my skills and knowledge, so employers know who I am and what I am good at. 
                    The Contact Me form and social media links give the easy option to get in contact with me. 
                    Also, I can add everything relevant to this website. 
                    All my professional experience is shared on this website. 
                    The website allows me to create my own style and present myself in a fitting way to the industry. 
                    Also, the fact that I created this website myself using HTML & CSS can testify to my skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2 id="Next">Next</h2>
                    After the personal branding module, I continued to expand my website. 
                    I have integrated my Unity games directly into this website for example. 
                    I have added JavaScript to check if the website is visited on a mobile device or not, to remove these integrated games on incompatible platforms for example. 
                    I have also added a small vertical navigation bar using JavaScript that can appear and disappear when the logo is clicked, so it will not always be onscreen and take up half of the screen length. 
                    I plan on continuing to support and improve this website for as long as possible.
