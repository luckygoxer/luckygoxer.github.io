        <h1>Rocket and Moon Animation</h1>
        <time>April 24, 2024</time>
        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>I created this 3D model of a rocket to learn how to animate in Autodesk Maya.
    <br>
        I created a quick sketch and started modeling the rocket, trying to use only my current knowledge of 3D modeling.
        Afterward, I watched a lot of tutorials on how to animate.
        In the end, I made an animation of a rocket taking off and landing on the moon, all using Autodesk Maya.

        <p>
            I started by creating a 3D model of a rocket in Autodesk Maya. 
            I tried to make a rocket based on my sketch with the current knowledge I had. 
            This way I tested my knowledge of 3D modeling. Only for the fins I needed some help. 
            I used a tutorial on deforming to create the rounded shape of the fins. 
            Using a Duplicate Special, I created 4 fins around the base of my rocket.  
        <br>
        <br>
            For the lighting, I started by setting up a Directional Light. 
            Afterward, I created Skydome Lighting using Image-Based Lighting. 
            I searched for an image that could be a beautiful background for my animation and that would be interesting as a lighting source. 
            I chose an image of a sky filled with colors and played around with brightness and exposure.  
        <br>
        <br>
            When I was happy with the lighting settings, I started giving the rocket and moon colors and textures. 
            I made some parts metallic and shiny, and other parts dark and rough retrospectively. 
            Afterward, I created different Bump Maps using Noise to give the models some bumpiness. 
            I wanted the imperfections to be visible, but subtle. 
            The lighting and imperfections are especially visible on the tip of the rocket.

        <br>
            Here you can see my 3D model. 
            However, due to a bug in Autodesk Maya, the textures would not export with my model to Sketchfab. 
            You can still see the model of my rocket and a bit of the lighting. 
            Fortunately, this issue does not arise in the final animation.  
        <br>
        <br>
            After finishing the lighting and textures, I started working on my animation. 
            I learned about Keyframes and how to use them to successfully animate a 3D object. 
            I watched a lot of videos on timing and tempo, and the animation principles by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston. 
            I used Anticipation, and Squash and Stretch at the same time just before the rocket takes off. 
            Similar to a human bending its knees in anticipation of the jump, I used the Squash Deformer to make the rocket bend down before ‘jumping’ into space. 
            I did this by moving the Squash Handle down and scaling it up, so it will squash from the base instead of the middle. 
            When the rocket takes off, it stretches a bit to strengthen the idea of speed. This secondary motion is called Follow Through. 
            These stretches are an Exaggeration of the rocket movement; a real rocket would of course not be able to deform and squash. 
            By moving my keyframes on intervals of multiples of 3, the Timing felt a lot better than my initial version.  
        <br>
        <br>
            I created a moon to land on with some texture using color and a Bump Map. 
            I created a curved Arc for my rocket to follow using a Bezier Curve. 
            The rocket will now take off into space, circle around the moon, and land slowly on the surface of the moon. 
            I slowed down the landing by adjusting the U Value at the end of the curve and setting a keyframe. 
            I used a locator to have the rocket aim at, so it does not spin all over the place following the track. 
            I created another Follow Through by squashing my rocket deformer a little bit when landing. 
            I hid my curve, locator, and deformer, and the animation was finished.  
        <br>
        <br>
            Of course, I wanted a video containing the animation with different camera angles, so I watched some tutorials on using cameras and the Camera Sequencer in Maya. 
            For each shot, I created a camera. The first camera looks at the rocket and turns upwards when the rocket takes off using keyframes. 
            The second camera is angled, looking at the rocket taking a turn to start circling the moon. 
            The third camera watches the rocket circling from a distance and the fourth looks like it is attached to the rocket. 
            It watches the rocket up close as it circles closer to the moon. I let the camera follow the rocket by using a Parent Constraint. 
            I used Camera Shake to add a greater sense of speed. 
            The fifth camera is similar to camera three and watches the rocket land slowly on the moon from a distance. 
            The final camera watches the rocket land up close again and uses the same camera shaking to dramatize the landing.  
        <br>
        <br>
            I assembled the shots by using the Camera Sequencer. 
            After hiding the cameras and the ‘earth’, I took a Playblast of the completed sequence, and the complete movie was done! 
            Afterwards, I exported my 3D model to Sketchfab, exported the playblast in a higher and a lower resolution (to enhance the loading time on this website), and created this webpage!

        <h1 id="Treehouse">Tree House (With Textures)</h1>
        <time>April 24, 2024</time>
        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>In the third term of my first year at Creative Media & Game Technologies, I created a 3D Model of a tree house with textures for the 3D Modeling course.
    <br>
        A couple of my focuses were using a consistent style and complex shapes (using beveled edges for example), creating extra textures enhancing the bland 3D Model, and UV unwrapping and welding.
