                <h1>Gamification of the Online Library app</h1>
                <time>March, 2025 - May, 2025</time>
                <h2 id="AboutLibrary">About:</h2>
                <p>
                    After empathizing with the target audience, I came to the following conclusion: the online library app is currently not very attractive. 
                    It is very simple and intuitive to use, but not fun to use or read books, which is, of course, the goal. 
                    The target users are youth between 12 and 18 years old. 
                    Only half of the youth read a book in their spare time, only once a week! 
                    I want them to train their skills by reading and listening more to books, to expand their knowledge of vocabulary, language, and grammar. 
                    Therefore, I will reconstruct the online library app to make it more attractive, interactive, and fun to use using gamification theory and elements; specifically, Structural Gamification. 
                    The revision is targeted at youth, but it should still be simple and attractive enough for kids and adults to use it too.”

                    The user has Autonomy over what books they choose to read and their profile by customizing their profile picture. 
                    Progress bars for the chapters and audiobooks are implemented so the user knows when the goal is hit, which fuels intrinsic motivation. 
                    The leaderboard is used for Social Connection and will enhance the user's intrinsic  motivation through social reinforcement. 
                    The competition also functions as an extrinsic motivator. 
                    XP and badges can be obtained, functioning as extrinsic motivators. 
                    A level system functioning as a gamified rewards program unlocks new profile pictures as an achievement to give the user motivation to obtain XP. 
                    Badges can be obtained by participating in time-limited challenge events. 
                <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Epic Meaning is achieved by telling the user that 646K players got this badge already before them, so the user wants to be part of that group.</li>
                        <li>Accomplishment is achieved through XP as Status Points, Badges, Fixed Action or Earned Lunch through challenges, the Leaderboard, and Progress Bars.</li>
                        <li>Empowerment of Creativity is achieved by having the user express themself creatively when writing a review and giving Feedback. 
                            The user can also express themself by customizing their profile picture.</li>
                        <li>Ownership is mainly achieved through Collection Sets: the challenge Badges are a series. 
                            The user can also customize their profile picture to feel closer to their digital persona.</li>
                    </ul>
                    These White Hat Core Drives do not create any sense of urgency. 
                <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Social Influence is achieved by Friending other users and the badges that function as a Trophy Shelf.</li>
                        <li>Scarcity is achieved by Prize Pacing because the badges are sets. 
                            A Count Down Timer is also displayed for the badges to display how long the user has to complete the challenge and obtain the badge. 
                            A Last Mile Drive is displayed after obtaining XP; a message is shown on how much more XP is needed to beat a friend.</li>
                        <li>Unpredictability is achieved by having Sudden Rewards; the user wrote their first review and earned a secret Profile Picture.</li>
                        <li>Avoidance is achieved by having a Sunk Cost Prison; if the user does not log in daily, the XP streak will stop exponentially adding up, and the user has to start with a small XP boost again on day 1. 
                            It is also a form of Streaking. 
                            The challenges that are only for a couple of days to obtain an exclusive badge are a form of an Evanescence Opportunity and could be seen as a FOMO Punch for not getting the badge in time. </li>
                    </ul>
                    These Black Hat Core Drives create a sense of urgency. 
                <br>
                    I created messages for limited-time events and daily logins, functioning as triggers that get the user in the Engagement Loop. 
                    After the task or Action is completed, an amount of XP, badge, or profile picture is gained as a Variable Reward. 
                    Setting a new profile picture could be seen as an Investment. 
                    After the Investment or Variable Reward, a message is shown with how much XP is needed to beat a friend, which functions as a Trigger for a ‘new’ Engagement Loop. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    Many of these theories and gamification elements have been implemented in apps like Duolingo, Coffee Break, and YouVersion. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    As a result of user testing, I added XP to battle your friends, a page to add friends, a daily login system, messages for limited-time events, a level system, and rounded some corners. 
                    I also added Epic Meaning and Unpredictability to represent every Octalysis Core Drive.

                    The online library app is now more attractive and fun to use, because Structural Gamification theory is applied. 
                    The little goals and rewards in between sessions will make it easier for the user to stay focused and get motivated to read more. 
                    “On brand” UI images and icons are created and used to not break the immersion for the user. 
                    Daily login reminders will trigger the user to read more often. 
                    This way, the user will expand their vocabulary and knowledge of language and grammar. 
                    Both young and old can use the app because it is simple and accessible.
